# Minimum-Error-Rate-Classifier

Problem Description:
Design a minimum error rate classifier for a two class problem with given data (assuming they follow
normal distribution):

1. Classify the sample points from “test.txt”.
2. Classified samples should have different colored markers according to the assigned class label.
3. Draw a figure which should include these points, the corresponding probability distribution function
along with its contour.
4. Draw decision boundary.
You can not use library function for calculating values from normal distribution.
